## Search Engine Optimization
---
Search engine optimization allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
Due to the increase in users accessing the internet more frequently, and from different locations.

## Online Reputation Management
---
Online reputation management gives you the ability to control what others see about your business.
Especially important because of the ability for anyone to post their opinion about your business, or site.

## Social Media Marketing
---
Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms fit your business the best, using analytics to find the best markets, and increase your lead generation.
This is a must have in a world that is continually seeing an increase in social media users.

# Changes

The following items are all the things I changed in both the index.html file, and the css style sheet.

## HTML Changes
---
* Added semantic elements by changing some divs to header and footer, to streamline the header and footer elements.
* Changed some div elements to section elements in order to organize, and make the code look less jumbled.
* Added informative alt descriptions to all images.
* Removed uneccessary class selectors and changed them to ids to minimize certain lines of code.
* Added commenting to all main sections of code, and also all images.
 ## CSS Changes
 ---
 * Reorganized the order of the selectors, in order for them to match the order of the HTML elements.
 * Changed many of the class selectors to ids in order to match the changes in the HTML document.
 * Added comments to every selector in the style sheet.
